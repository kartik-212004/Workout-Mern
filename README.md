Workout Tracker Application
 I have successfully accomplished a Workout Tracker application that enables users to create and manage their workout routines. This project was developed as part of my continuous self-improvement and learning process and demonstrates my competency in modern web development technologies.

Technologies Used:
Frontend:

React: This technology was used for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
React Router DOM: This was put in place for client-side routing so that users can move through the different views of the application seamlessly.
Tailwind CSS: The necessity in styling the application with utility-first CSS that allows for fast and responsive design.
Vite: Development build tool for a faster, leaner development experience.
ESLint: Configured to retain code quality and homogeneity throughout the project.
Backend:

Express: Used as the web application framework for building the server-side logic to handle API requests.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing workout data and user details.
NPM Packages:

Frontend:

react
react-dom
react-router-dom
validator
@types/react
@types/react-dom
@vitejs/plugin-react
autoprefixer
eslint
eslint-plugin-react
eslint-plugin-react-hooks
eslint-plugin-react-refresh
postcss
tailwindcss
vite
Backend:

bcrypt: For hashing passwords to have secure user authentication. cors: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and thus let the frontend talk to the backend. dotenv: Environment variables should be handled securely. express: This is the main framework of the web application. jsonwebtoken: For secure JWT-based authentication implementation. mongoose: As an ODM - Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB - to support schema-based data validation and interaction. nodemon: The server restarts itself during development in case of file changes.
validator: Sanitize and validate user input.
Project Features:
Developed a full-stack application using state-of-the-art technologies in web development
Implemented a user authentication system with secure data handling
Made a responsive and user-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS
Implemented RESTful APIs using Express in order to handle workout data CRUD
Managed the data flexibly and efficiently using MongoDB.
This project showcases the ability to build from scratch a full-stack web application for perfect user experience delivery using frontend and backend technologies.
